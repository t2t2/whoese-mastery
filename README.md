# Whose Mastery is it Anyway?

"Whose Mastery is it Anyway?" is a real-time game for clubs & parties to help figure out why does that one friend have 100k mastery points on Swain anyway.

## Meta

The more you play with friends, the more you know how they play, know where they like to play and what they like to play. This game puts these skills to test, by taking champion mastery infromation for all of the players and generating hard hitting questions. How well do you know your premade? Time to find out.

(The game requires at least 2 players, though more are heavily reccomended for the increased confusion)
